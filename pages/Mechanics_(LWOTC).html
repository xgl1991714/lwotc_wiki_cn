        To-Hit Mechanics
       </span>
      </h2>
      <p>
       The following hit mechanics in Long War 2 have been modified:
      </p>
      <dl>
       <dd>
        Critical chance is no longer an absolute chance
        <dl>
         <dd>
          In base XCOM 2 a 10% hit and 10% critical chance would land 10% of the time, and if it hit would always be a critical. This is no longer the case.
         </dd>
         <dd>
          Dodge no longer supersedes crit. (In base XCOM 2 if dodge + crit chance was greater than hit, crit chance would be removed in favor of dodge.)
         </dd>
         <dd>
          Soldiers can graze even if the target has no dodge (In base XCOM 2, grazes were only possible if the target had dodge stat)
         </dd>
         <dd>
          These changes apply completely symmetrically to both sides
         </dd>
        </dl>
       </dd>
       <dd>
        All units will now graze if their to-hit roll is “close” to the required to hit
        <dl>
         <dd>
          This is referred to as the “Graze Band.” The measure of “close” is configurable in-game, and defaults to +/- 10%.
         </dd>
         <dd>
          Example 1 : Base 70% chance to hit results in 60% chance of a normal damage hit and 20% chance of a graze. The displayed to hit is 70%.
         </dd>
         <dd>
          Example 2 : Base 20% chance to hit results in 10% chance of a normal damage hit and a 20% chance of a graze. The displayed to hit is 20%.
         </dd>
        </dl>
       </dd>
       <dd>
        Critical Hit Chance is now a chance to “promote” the damage type. A successful critical roll will:
        <dl>
         <dd>
          Promote a graze hit to a regular damage hit
         </dd>
         <dd>
          Promote a regular damage hit to a critical damage hit
         </dd>
        </dl>
       </dd>
       <dd>
        Dodge Stat is now a chance to “demote” the damage type. A successful dodge roll will:
        <dl>
         <dd>
          Demote critical damage hit to regular damage hit
         </dd>
         <dd>
          Demote a regular damage hit to a graze
         </dd>
         <dd>
          Demote a graze into a miss (configurable)
         </dd>
        </dl>
       </dd>
       <dd>
        Good Angle Bonus Removed
        <dl>
         <dd>
          The good angle bonus of XCom 2 vanilla is removed, this bonus used to give you aim bonuses as you got closer to a flanking angle. There are no bonuses to aim and crit until you are fully flanking a target now.
         </dd>
        </dl>
       </dd>
       <dd>
        Consequences:
        <dl>
         <dd>
          Low % shots are generally more likely to do something, but that something results in less damage, and is very unlikely to deal critical damage
         </dd>
         <dd>
          90% to-hit and above won’t entirely miss enemies (unless they have dodge)
         </dd>
         <dd>
          Dodge and Crit counter each other, so a high critical chance helps counter high dodge units, while a good dodge helps protect against critical hits
         </dd>
         <dd>
          When using Not Created Equally, soldiers may have negative dodge, increasing the chance hits against them will be promoted
         </dd>
        </dl>
       </dd>
       <dd>
        Example 1: 90% to hit, 50% to crit
        <dl>
         <dd>
          In base XCOM 2, this will result in Critical damage 50%, Normal damage 40% of the time, Miss 10% of the time.
         </dd>
         <dd>
          In Long War 2, this will result in Critical damage 40% of the time, Normal damage 50% of the time, Graze damage 10% of the time.
          <dl>
           <dd>
            Pre-critical results are 80% hit, 20% graze. Critical chance promotes half of the normal hits (40% of total) to critical, and half of the grazing hits (10% of total) to normal hits.
           </dd>
          </dl>
         </dd>
        </dl>
       </dd>
       <dd>
        Example 2: 20% to hit, 10% to crit
        <dl>
         <dd>
          In base XCOM 2, this will result in Critical damage 10% of the time, Normal damage 10% of the time, Miss 80% of the time
         </dd>
         <dd>
          In Long War 2, it will result in Critical damage 1% of the time, Normal damage 11% of the time, Graze damage 18% of the time, Miss 70% of the time
          <dl>
           <dd>
            Pre-critical results are 10% hit, 20% graze. Critical chance promotes one tenth of hits so 1% normal hits become critical, 2% grazing hits become normal.
           </dd>

        Enemy Patrol Behavior
       </span>
      </h2>
      <p>
       To truly understand how patrols in LW2 are different, it's important to understand how they were in vanilla.
      </p>
      <dl>
       <dd>
        In vanilla, there would always be one pod that would be stationed between XCOM and the objective. If that pod was killed, another pod would move to come between XCOM and the objective. Even if the pods were not active, they would, in a way, know where XCOM was. In similar fashion, pod patrol routes would dynamically adjust based on the location of XCOM.

          Green alert level is most commonly the beginning of a mission when a squad is still in concealment. Advent has no idea that XCOM has infiltrated and as such, is on low alert. A pod activated on the alien turn in this state may take defensive actions (each unit has a percentage chance that scales with difficulty) such as hunkering or overwatch on activation, but will not make any offensive moves. In other words, they will not get a chance to take a free shot at XCOM.

          An enemy pod at Yellow alert level is not activated yet. However, it is aware of XCOM activity in the area due to sound from rocket/grenade explosions, gun shots, yelling civilians, or by finding the corpses of dead allies. Pods at this alert level will move toward any suspicious sounds they hear. If a pod is activated on an enemy turn, they may take opportunistic shots at XCOM or perform other such actions as they scamper for cover. Patrols in yellow alert run instead of walk, and may take certain actions (such as Sectoid's

Berserk makes the soldier go into a frenzy and perform random offensive actions. Obsessed only triggers from fears of an enemy and forces the soldier to approach them and unload their weapon against them.

       The radius at which enemies can detect you in concealment is called the Detection Range, and this scales based on a variety of factors. Be aware that detection tiles do not appear on obstacles that can be walked across such as benches. Large Units also tends to have slightly misleading detection and may be slightly larger than it appears.

      <p>
       At baseline 100% infiltration, enemies will have their normal detection range.  At infiltration rates below 100%, the enemy will have between between x1 and x1.25 of normal detection radius (i.e up to 1/4th more); conversely, at infiltration rates above 100%, the enemy will have between x1 and x0.8334 of normal detection radius (i.e. up to 1/6th less).  The effect scales linearly; for example, at 50% Infiltration, enemy detection range gets a 1/8 bonus (half the maximum bonus of 1/4).

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       There are three tiers of potential damage falloff depending on distance from detonation point:
None (up to half blast radius distance)
25% (up to 75% of blast radius distance)
50% (outermost 25%)
      </p>
      <p>
       Initially rolled damage gets reduced by a random amount (starting at 0%) up to this potential damage falloff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Resulting damage gets rounded down but cannot go lower than 1.

        Environmental Damage
       </span>
      </h2>
      <p>
       There are 3 kinds of destructible objects which all have some "toughness", or can be seen as "environmental health", that determines how much damage needs to be dealt before they are destroyed.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Simple destructibles: have a single toughness value where enough damage instantly destroys the object. ex. tables or wooden fences
       </li>
       <li>
        Fractional destructibles: similar to simple destructibles but have multiple parts/stages which can be destroyed partially or completely based on the damage dealt. ex. walls or floors
       </li>
       <li>
        Annihilation destructibles: these objects have two stages, damaged and annihilated. These objects have two toughness values. An example are cars where if enough damage is dealt they become damaged and continue to take damage over time until enough is dealt and becomes annihilated.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Despite objects having a "toughness" value, this is not an actual health value but a threshold. An object cannot be eventually destroyed by doing so through multiple hits. Either enough environmental damage is dealt to change the object states or nothing occurs. One exception are targetable objects such as gas tanks or objectives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Long War greatly changes the impact explosives and weapons have against the environment in the battlefield. Frag grenades have significantly lower environmental damage and very rarely destroys cover (this can be boosted with

        Combat Engineer
       </a>
       ). Enemy explosives however are slightly better than XCOM's and are more likely to destroy cover, be cautious of them. This makes cover more important on both sides and requires more careful consideration in 
positioning.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition to this, just like with explosive damage, environmental damage also
suffers damage falloff from the point of impact when using explosives making it more difficult to level out cover completely (this can be removed by using

        Combat Engineer
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       Similar to how damage is dealt, there is also variance with 
the environmental damage dealt ranging from +/- 20% spread.

      </h2>
      <p>
       In long war, cover defense is worth more and thus generally have more of an effect and important to use to stay safe. Low cover now grants 30 defense and high cover now grants 45 defense.

       Hacking is an ability that can be used for objectives or by the

        Specialist
       </a>
       class with their gremlin which can also be used on Advent Poles or against robotic enemies with

        Haywire Protocol
       </a>
       . The hacking chance is based on the attacker's hacking score, the defender's hack defense, some amount of variance and various modifiers depending on what is being hacked and what the attempted result is. There are a few notes to keep in mind about hacking.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        A robotic enemy can only be hacked once per mission and cannot be re-attempted. This means that you can't continuously mind control a robotic enemy after it wears out or retry if you failed an attempt.

        can target enemies within reasonable line of sight whether they are within their own vision or an alliles from squadsight. These abilities are not the same as hacking objectives or Advent Poles which requries the Specialists' own line of sight in order to begin hacking.
       </li>
       <li>
        When hacking a jail cell during Jailbreaks, the doors are opened upon success and granting control of all the rookies/rebels within to begin escaping. This is not the case for VIP missions which require opening the door manually with a soldier and having the VIP within line of sight in order to take control of them and begin escaping.

      </h2>
      <p>
       All units with a gun can enter "overwatch" allowing them to take a reactive shot against an enemy that moves at least two tiles within vision. All reaction attacks will suffer a 30% aim penalty meaning that an attack will have its final aim result multiplied by 0.7 to calculate the final hit chance. For example, if the attack would have an 80% chance to hit, the final result for a reactive attack would be 56%. For targets that are dashing, the penalty is increased to 40%.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are optional changes that only apply if the
       <b>

       mod is
       <b>

      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Overwatch now triggers as soon as the unit moves, which makes it no longer possible to perform 1-tile moves to avoid overwatch. The implementation right now is not perfect and this change may not always function correctly, depending on factors like line of sight, although typically overwatch should now more consistently trigger as targets move or step into range.
       </li>
       <li>
        This change makes it easier to trigger overwatch while in cover, but overwatch shots now ignore 25 cover defense.

      <p>
       Weapon mods can be obtained through enemy loot drops similarly to the base game. All weapons have 3 available weapon slots and can be freely equipped and removed from them. The plasma rifle is unique in that it has a special property allowing it to have 4 weapon slots.
Some weapon mods occupy the same slots and are thus mutually exclusive. Scopes and lasers sights cannot be used together as well as expanded magazines with autoloaders.
      </p>
      <h2>
       <span class="mw-headline" id="Concealment">
        Concealment
       </span>
      </h2>
      <p>
       On some missions, the squad can start in concealment which enemies will not be able to detect them unless within a certain range. Concealment allows you to sneak around or set up positions for an ambush. Most offensive actions and noisy actions such as breaking through windows or ramming doors will reveal the squad and make ADVENT aware of xcom presence in the area allowing them to engage when in vision. An action will reveal the soldier or squad if there is a red eye icon in the UI when selecting the action.
      </p>
      <p>
       During concealment there are a few additional bonuses that can be used offensively. Any overwatch set during concealment do not suffer overwatch penalties and will fire at the full aim the shot is capable of. Additionally, all enemies will behave as if they have 0 dodge (this does not mean graze band will not apply).
