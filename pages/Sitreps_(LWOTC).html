       Sitreps are additional modifiers that affects the mission with a 30% chance to apply one. These can be beneficial, neutral, or negative towards XCOM.
      </p>
      <p>
       Strategic Dark Events have also changed and now instead of applying to all missions they all have a 40% chance to apply as a sitrep to any missions that spawn during its duration. Dark Event sitreps are in addition to any base sitreps that are part of the mission. Only one dark event sitrep can apply to a given mission.
      </p>
      <p>
       Depending on the sitreps applied during the mission, they are given a "difficulty" rating and will reward 2 AP upon a successful mission for each "difficult" sitrep.
