       These additional options are available to change how campaigns play.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Beta strike: Greatly increase all units' HP to extend tactical battles and increases mission/reinforcement timers to accommodate. Note that LWOTC is not balanced around this and you will have trouble with reinforcements in particular if you don't mod the game further. Use at own risk!
       </li>
       <li>
        Reaper/Skirmisher/Templar Ally: Choose your starting hero instead of receiving a random one.
       </li>
       <li>
        Grim Horizon: All Dark Events become permanent. This affects strategical events such as Rapid Response and is independent of tactical upgrade Dark Events such as conditioning which are permanent by default.
       </li>
       <li>
        Lengthy Scheme: Doubles the Avatar timer. Long War extends the timer by default, so this option massively increases the amount of work needed for the Avatar project to complete.
       </li>
       <li>
        No Hand Holding: Disable LWOTC's tutorial pop ups such as introduction of some new enemies and the new strategy changes.
       </li>
       <li>
        Chosen on holiday: The Chosen are completely absent from the campaign.
       </li>
       <li>
        Baby Chosen: Disable Chosen prime reactions, which allow them to perform certain actions whenever damaged.
       </li>
       <li>
        Strategic Dominance: Enables the use of Resistance Orders, the cards that grant additional bonuses and can be assigned at the end of the month. Note that LWOTC is not balanced around the player having access to Resistance Orders.
       </li>
       <li>
        Same rank abilities: Allows spending AP to purchase additional perks on the same rank that a perk has already been selected.
       </li>
       <li>
        Hybrid Difficulty: Increases all tactical layer changes by one difficulty level over the created campaign's selected difficulty. For example, enabling this option while selecting the "Commander" difficulty level will make all tactical layer changes such as enemy stats be configured at the "Legend" difficulty.
       </li>
      </ul>
