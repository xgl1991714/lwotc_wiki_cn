      <p>
       Enemy Activity refers to the quantity of enemies deployed on a map. Enemy Activity Level is an estimation of the number of enemy units you will encounter at 100% infiltration; the
       <b>
        actual
       </b>
       number of enemy units depends on your infiltration rate (for more information, see the
       <a href="../pages/Infiltration_(LWOTC).html" title="Infiltration (LWOTC)">
        Infiltration
       </a>
       page). In general, at 0% infiltration, the number will be several steps higher than the baseline; at 200% infiltration, it will be a few steps lower. These steps are dependent on mission type and do not necessarily correspond to one Enemy Activity Level per step.

          Evac timers put an absolute limit on mission duration. Any soldier still on the map when the timer reaches 0 is lost (captured). When the timer reaches 1, the last turn start (there is no "0 turns left" turn).

        Generating Missions
       </span>
      </h2>
      <p>
       Missions spawn automatically as the days pass, and expire after a given window of time. The mission is not visible at this time; the local haven must collect enough intel to reveal the mission. Assigning more resistance members to the "intel" job can make missions considerably easier by discovering missions earlier and allowing more time to infiltrate. A mission's expiration timer starts when it is created, not when it is discovered; most infiltration missions have a base duration of 18 days, which is randomized by a few days each time a mission is created.
      </p>
      <p>
       Havens each generate "intel points" from having personnel assigned to intel gathering. These points are applied to undiscovered missions in the region at certain update intervals, currently 4 times a day (every 6 hours). Each mission keeps a pool of collected intel points. The difficulty of discovering a certain type of mission is controlled by two numbers: "required intel" and "discovery chance". A mission cannot be detected until you generate intel equal to the "required intel" value. Once the minimum is reached there is a random chance (1/4 of discovery chance) to discover the mission at every update. The probability is based on the mission's "percent chance" stat, multiplied by the number of intel points collected past the required minimum.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a flat % detection bonus based on the force level and also based on difficulty. Additionally there is a flat % detection bonus for the first 5 days of a campaign to make detecting the first two missions of a campaign less RNG.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the table below, a basic level-0 resistance member is defined as one "intel point" per day. A level-1 resistance member is worth 1.5 points, a level-2 is worth 2, and the Avenger scanning is worth 4. A scientist assigned as haven liaison adds an extra 20% bonus to the entire haven. Each faceless reduces overall intel point generation by 3/5/6/7% depending on difficulty (regardless of what job the faceless is doing).

        Example:
       </b>
       A haven with six level-0 resistance members and one level-1 assigned to intel, plus a scientist liaison, generates 9 "points" per day. The first mission in the liberation chain spawns. The haven can't detect this mission until it generates 22 points, which takes just under 2.5 days.
      </p>
      <p>
       One day after that, the haven has an 4.5% chance to detect the mission: it has 9 intel points in the pool (subtracting out the 22 needed for the required intel) times 2 per point, resulting in 18 discovery chance which means you'll have 4.5% chance to detect the mission every 6 hours. One day later, the haven has 18 points and has a 36 discovery chance (9% to detect every 6 hours).

        Types of Missions
       </span>
      </h2>
      <p>
       The type of mission affects a variety of factors: what the primary objective is, what type of rewards will be received, how long the squad has to complete the objective, how strong of a force the enemy will tend to field relative to other missions in the region, whether the squad starts concealed or not, and even where the squad can extract from.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps the most important factor is whether or not a squad needs to infiltrate or not, and how long the squad has to do it. For more information on infiltration mechanics, see the

         Liberation 4
        </b>
        - Regional Network Tower Liberation: XCOM must deploy to and liberate an ADVENT network tower. This will not expire once unlocked, and is quite difficult. A small squad (up to five soldiers) must hack a console at the far end of the map. Doing so disables the reinforcement timer and stuns all remaining enemies for 2 turns. The mission ends only when there are no remaining enemies, and reinforcements will come rapidly once the alarm is raised.

       Note that failing or skipping a liberation mission does not reset the path. You'll just have to detect it again (unless it's the tower or base, which are persistent once you unlock them).
      </p>
      <p>
       After Liberation 2 is completed, ADVENT's desired Strength in the region is increased by 1, effectively equal to having a Vigilance one higher than displayed in-game.
      </p>
      <p>
       Liberating a region adds 1 Vigilance to all unliberated regions world-wide. Adjacent regions receive an additional 1-2 Vigilance.

        Covert Action Missions
       </span>
      </h3>
      <p>
       Covert Actions missions are initiated by completing certain Covert Actions. They are generally very beneficial missions.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Ambush: Upon completing a covert action, there is a
        <a href="../pages/Resistance_Ring_(LWOTC).html" title="Resistance Ring (LWOTC)">
         chance
        </a>
        the covert squad gets ambushed and needs help evacuating to escape being captured. You can send up to 4 soldiers on a quick response mission (no infiltration) who start at a fixed evac location. There are roughly 8 enemies on this mission, 1 group next to the covert squad to incapacitate them with 2 other groups to halt their escape. You will also control the covert squad in which at least one soldier must reach the evac before reinforcements overwhelm you to succeed in the rescue and the covert action they were sent to.
       </li>
       <li>
        Big Supply Extraction: This is a normal supply extraction but with 18 crates instead of 12. However, Advent will mark 3 crates instead of 2.
       </li>
       <li>
        Locate Patrols: This is a normal troop column mission, except that you can only send up to 6 soldiers and it does not destroy strength in the target region. The number of enemies on this mission is based on its region strength as normal, but it is capped at 4.
       </li>
       <li>
        Chosen Stronghold: After completing all 3 Chosen Hunt Cover Actions for one Chosen, you will be able to infiltrate their stronghold. You can only send up to 5 soldiers who will have to first work their way through an indoor maze of rooms filled with pods of 2-4 enemies. Make sure all your soldiers are on the elevator before you send them in to face the Chosen! You will load into a new map, where you will face a small pod before encountering the Chosen's Sarcophagus. You must first kill the Chosen, then damage the Sarcophagus as quickly as possible, dealing with reinforcements while the Chosen is inside the Sarcophagus. The Chosen will regain hit points for each turn the Sarcophagus remains intact, respawning when they reach 100% hp or when the Sarcophagus is destroyed. You must kill the Chosen one last time after their Sarcophagus is destroyed.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
       <span class="mw-headline" id="UFO_Hunt">
        UFO Hunt
       </span>
      </h3>
      <p>
       ADVENT may launch a dark event that sends a UFO to hunt the avenger. After 6-14 days, the UFO intercepts the avenger in which there is a 50% chance to avoid them. If successful, an avenger defense launches requiring XCOM to defend itself and destroy the spike emitting EMP preventing the avenger from escaping. The mission must be completed in order for XCOM to escape and continue the fight or all is lost. Once a campaign has experienced at least one avenger defense mission, any future UFO hunts have a 0/25/35/50% (based on difficulty) chance to intercept the avenger.
      </p>
      <p>
       A UFO may also be launched once XCOM completes a story mission objective (blacksite/forge/psi gate) with a 25/75/100% chance respectively and this can only occur once meaning that, for example, if the blacksite has triggered a hunt, then completing the psi gate will not trigger another. These UFOs are guaranteed to intercept the avenger unless one has already occurred in which it uses the interception chances after the first listed above.

       At the end of each month, the Chosen's Knowledge bar fills and they choose an activity. Two of those activities spawn missions for XCOM to fight through.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <b>
         Chosen Supply Raid
        </b>
        : This activity is available at knowledge tier 1. Some time after the activity is selected, a quick response full salvage supply raid mission will launch.
        <ul>
         <li>
          It has a concealed start and squad size is limited to 6.
         </li>
         <li>
          The mission is fixed at alert level 4 (including Chosen adjustment). This means that the expected enemy activity is around 13-15 including Chosen.
         </li>
         <li>
          If the Chosen succeeds in this activity (i.e. the mission is ignored or failed), 1 strength is added to the region it is launched in and to 1 random adjacent region.
         </li>
         <li>
          The Chosen will trigger the activity in a region they control that XCOM has contacted. This can fail if there is no contacted unliberated region under their control.
         </li>
         <li>
          These missions are guaranteed to have Stun Lancers.

         Chosen Avenger Defense
        </b>
        : When one of the Chosen reaches 100% Knowledge, they will launch an all-out assault on the Avenger. This Chosen Avenger Defense (CAD) will take place between 2 and 10 days after the beginning of the month in which the Chosen filled their bar. The mission composes of 30/34/36/40 enemies (based on difficulty) with 1 pod that guards the three various turret locations ( the large cannon and 2 sets of mini-turret mounted trucks )  within the map with the rest of the enemies slowly approaching the avenger. XCOM must defeat all enemies while also destroying the turrets before the avenger is destroyed. The avenger has 550 HP with the Chosen Cannon dealing 80 damage every 7/6/5/4 (based on difficulty) turns and the mini turrets dealing 4 damage each every turn. Only the cannon is required to destroy however destroying the turrets will be helpful.

        Golden Path Missions

      <p>
       Some missions and activities are required for the story to proceed. These missions are collectively called "the golden path". All golden path missions require 100% infiltration before you can launch them. Regional strength does not affect the number of enemies on any golden path mission except for the Liberation Missions.

        Skulljacking:
        <ul>
         <li>
          After skulljacking an officer for the first time, a codex will appear. If you kill it, you will retrieve its body, no matter whether you are on a full salvage mission or not. If you do not kill it, you will have to wait until you encounter another codex and kill it there. Skulljacking another officer will also spawn another codex.
         </li>
         <li>
          After skulljacking a codex for the first time (and after researching Encrypted Codex Data in the Shadow Chamber), an avatar will appear. Just like the codex, you will retrieve its body as long as you kill it and you can continue skulljacking more codices if you fail to kill it; however, unlike the codex, avatars will not appear normally on missions - you will

There are 34/37/37/41 enemies to encounter, in addition to reinforcements.

          Note that this mission is full salvage, but only for the enemies that you actually kill, so if you need any corpses to build any last items before taking on waterworld (you won't get to research anything), you should make sure to kill that enemy before hacking the tower and ending the mission.

      <p>
       Long War 2 uses the correct term for military equipment and supplies:
       <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materiel" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">
        materiel
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Most missions in Long War 2 require you to evacuate and you do not keep the bodies of fallen ADVENT or Aliens. As corpses are much more valuable in Long War 2 players should make special consideration for missions which do allow them to keep the corpses of fallen foes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The following mission types allow collection of enemy materiel:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Ambush troop column: Ambush a small ADVENT troop column and clear the area of hostiles, Succeeding this will reduce the region's strength by 1. Can only be detected if the region is at least of strength 4.
       </li>
       <li>
        Supply convoy ambush: Disrupt Advent supply transports and destroy ADVENT troops. Succeeding this will prevent strength from being transported into the region but greatly increase vigilance.
       </li>
       <li>
        Invasion: Advent attempts to re-establish their psionic network in the region and launches a full scale attack against the resistance. You must clear the area of hostiles and rescue any resistance leaders while also defending against continuous reinforcements until the emitter is destroyed.
       </li>
       <li>
        Rendezvous: Disrupt an ADVENT rendezvous with the faceless spy. The assigned soldier advisor along with up to 5 resistance leaders joins to remove the spy while also eliminating their contacts.
       </li>
       <li>
        Regional HQ assault: Assault the regional HQ to remove the General in the region and reclaim the area from the aliens control and removing them from the region. If the General is eliminated all enemies will converge to your location in an attempt to eliminate you. This will also occur if there are less than 8 enemies left in the area.
       </li>
       <li>
        Secure UFO: Secure the landed UFO by eliminating all hostiles in the area. When revealed, a distress beacon is activated and must be stopped. Failure to do so will have reinforcements called in forcing a retreat and the inability to secure the UFO and its resources. Succeeding this will grant 1 avenger power while also preventing the aliens from increasing the global strength level.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       It should be noted that while Smash N Grab missions list Enemy Material as their reward, they no longer allow the collection of corpses from the battlefield. Unlike the five missions listed above, material recovered from Smash N Grabs is not dependent on the state of the battlefield, only on the number of ADVENT Resource Caches successfully retrieved. The Resource Caches can provide Alloys, Elerium, Elerium Cores, or Supplies, but not corpses.

      <p>
       As Vahlen has taught us, explosives destroy all recoverable materiel when delivering the killing blow as both a possible loot drop and the corpse will be destroyed. Flamethrowers also destroy corpses if the initial hit kills the target, though burning damage will leave a collectible corpse and drop timed loot if carried. Consider using the Needle Grenades perk for grenadiers if you are in need of explosives use.
      </p>

       It may be beneficial to sabotage your infiltration percentage to increase the enemy presence if you feel you will be victorious. You are allowed to start any infiltration mission early from the Geoscape. Note that enemy readiness will also be boosted if you begin prematurely, increasing their detection range, evac delay, and reinforcements strength. For supply convoys, troop columns and UFOs, enemies also gain a flat aim and defense bonus with their HP multiplied based on infiltration in intervals of 25% (0-24/25-49/50-74/75-99). Although there is great reward in acquiring plenty of corpses, it is important to be wary of the great risks involved that may be more harmful than its worth.
